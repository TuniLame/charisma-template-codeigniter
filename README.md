Description
----

Charisma is a HTML theme created by Muahammad Usman (https://github.com/usmanhalalit). I saw myself using it so much that I decided to share my Charisma for CodeIgniter files.

How to use it?
----
Just copy all the repository and paste it on your CodeIgniter root folder, behind `application` and `system`.
You will need just to merge some folders (`application` and `static`, if you have one)
  
The static files are located under `static` folder.
Only one controller was added: `application/controllers/charisma.php`, the class is named Charisma and has for now, only one view: `Index` which will show the index.html equivalent page.
The others will be added as soon as possible...
  
  
  
Changelog
----
01.10.2013	Added a root variable so that `charisma.js` becomes dynamic to get the CSS's bootstrap theme file.
