Description
----

Charisma is a HTML theme created by Muahammad Usman (https://github.com/usmanhalalit). I saw myself using it so much that I decided to share my Charisma for CodeIgniter files.

How to use it?
----
Just copy all the repository and paste it on your CodeIgniter root folder, behind `application` and `system`.
You will need just to merge some folders (`application` and `static`, if you have one)
